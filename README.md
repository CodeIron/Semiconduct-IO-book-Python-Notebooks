Jupyter Notebooks for the book: "Semiconductor Integrated Optics for Switching Light" 2nd Edition

January 2021

For the second edition of this book some of the Mathematica notebooks were translated to python notebooks (with the file extension .pynb). All the notebooks were developed in Google’s colab environment https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb and are available from a Github repository at :-

The optimum way to use notebooks is to run them in the colab platform – this best is done with a Google account with the notebooks upload to Google drive and from there on to Colab.
